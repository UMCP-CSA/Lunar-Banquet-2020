                        Then, we will begin the show stream on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.twitch.tv/umcpcsa">Twitch</a>. 
                        Everyone can stay on Zoom to discuss the show and hang out while watching the stream individually on Twitch! (For the best quality üòè)
                        Before and during Lunar Banquet, feel free to <Link to="/dares">dare</Link> one of our members and help them fill their dare meter!
                        All of the proceeds will be donated to Feeding America to help fight hunger.
                        <br /><br />
                        We hope to see you there!

                        Each board member has a list of dares. Once their donation meter meets a certain threshold, they will perform
                        the dare and post it on the 'Completed Dares' tab. You can name your own price for the donation, and all proceeds
                        will go to the nonprofit organization Feeding America.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can check the dares list for each member by clicking 'View Dares'! Your donation will work towards the next
                        tier dare for that member.
